                              Welcome,

                              I have always enjoyed watching these kinds of videos, especially as it
                              encourages us
                              to use that one palette we have and be creative with the kinds of looks we can
                              create!

                              I hope you enjoy this video - apologies, in the first look I actually wasn't
                              planning
                              on recording it as a proper makeup tutorial, I was testing out another set of
                              Aliexpress brushes, until a lovely subscriber requested it, so I thought to
                              include
                              it in this look! Also when I mention 'Peaches' in the 2nd look I meant the shade
                              'Danger'!

                              Please give this a video a like if you enjoy this series so I'll know to do more
                              with
                              the palettes I have! If you haven't already subscribed to my channel, it would
                              mean
                              the absolute world if you did!

                              Thank you so much for watching my video, I really appreciate your time and
                              attention.

                              Hope you are all well and staying safe.

                              xo,
                              Sharon Noelle
